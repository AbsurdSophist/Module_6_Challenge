# Module_6_Challenge
In this challenge we used visualizations to show trends in San Francisco neighborhoods, using hvplot and plotly libraries to gain clear insight into the data collected. 

We began by importing all data, and ploted housing units per year, grouping by the year. We then did the same for the average price per square foot, and then created an interactive graph using hvwidgets to create a dropdown menu to view the data by neighborhood. For our final step, we used scatter_mapbox to build an interactive map of the San Francisco neighborhoods. Doing so creates a clear picture of how gross rent and average price per square foot are impacted by location, plotting the data directly over a geographical map of the area. Overall, we can conclude that there are opportunities to invest in San Francisco neighborhoods, though the opportunities need to be properly analyzed (as we have done) due to changing factors that occur within a few miles of each neighborhood.
